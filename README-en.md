## ❓ Why you need this

**Nuitka** compiles Python into machine code. Your `.py` becomes a native `.exe`, and you can’t inspect it with standard tools. PyInstaller files can still be unpacked, but Nuitka files cannot.

**DeNuitkanizator** solves this problem. It:
- Shows what the file was built with
- Extracts everything possible: strings, modules, paths, IP addresses, URLs
- Fully disassembles the machine code
- Finds connections between code and strings
- Detects suspicious patterns

**Who it’s for:** reverse engineers, malware analysts, Python developers, security researchers.

> **Important:** this is not a decompiler. Nuitka compiles Python to C and then to machine code — fully restoring the original code is practically **impossible**.

> [!WARNING]
> ## Before using the program, please read the [EULA.md — End User License Agreement](https://github.com/2M12/DeNuitkanizator/blob/main/EULA-en.md)

> [!CAUTION]
> ### ❗ About fake copies
> Official sources are only those that are in the profile [2M12](https://github.com/2M12/2M12/blob/main/README.md ). I do not post anything on Telegram channels/groups or other sources (they are not official). If you come across something outside of this repository, these are false copies that often contain malware.

>[!NOTE]
> ### ❗ Important notes
> * Analysis results are **not guaranteed** - they depend on the Nuitka version, compilation settings, and LTO usage.
> * The tool is provided **as is**.
> * **Primary focus is Nuitka**, but the analyzer also works with PyInstaller, cx_Freeze, and other packers.
> * The program can analyze regular .exe files not written in Python.
> * PyInstaller provides more detailed info because it’s simpler and stores more metadata inside the .exe.
> * The program supports analyzing native .exe files and other packers.

## 🔍 Features

### 🕵️ Detection
* Identifies builds via **Nuitka** (using 8 signatures and `.rsrc` entropy).
* Distinguishes Nuitka from PyInstaller and cx_Freeze (marks as Unknown for other packers).
* Detects **Python version** (3.7–3.11) via magic numbers.

### 📥 Data extraction
* **Strings**: ASCII (4+/8+ characters), UTF‑16LE, UTF‑8.
* **Modules**: names of imported and frozen Python modules.
* **Source paths**: debug paths from `.rdata`/`.data`.
* **Variable and function names**: identifiers from data sections.
* **Network data**: IP addresses, URLs, email addresses.

### 🧩 PE structure analysis
* **Sections**: names, sizes, entropy, access rights, executable flag (EXEC).
* **Imports**: all DLLs and functions (including Python C API).
* **Exports**: exported functions.
* **Hashes**: MD5, SHA1, SHA256 of the file.
* **Compiler**: detection (MinGW GCC, MSVC, Clang/LLVM).
* **Protection mechanisms**: DEP, ASLR.

### 🗜️ Unpacking
* **Zstandard (zstd)**: main compression algorithm for Nuitka OneFile.
* **Zlib**: search and unpack alternative compressed blocks.
* Search for compressed blocks by signature: zlib, gzip, lzma, bzip2, zip.

### 💻 Disassembly (if Capstone is available)
* **Full disassembly** of all executable sections (`Disasm/full/`).
* **Entry Point**: with comments `[CALL]`, `[JMP]`, `[RET]`, `[ANTI-DEBUG]`.
* **Auto‑architecture detection**: x86 or x64 from the PE header.
* **String cross‑references** (`string_xrefs.txt`): which code references which strings.
* **Asm-to-C** technology translation: now (`.text_full.asm`) is fully translated into readable C code. Inspired by the line-by-line translation tool [cisol](https://github.com/rdbv/cisol)
* **The basis of Asm-to-C** technology: Registers, stack (`push`/`pop`), flags (`ZF`, `CF`, `OF`, `SF`, `PF`, `AF`) are emulated. Function calls are also emulated via `goto` tags.

>[!NOTE]
> ### 🔄 Asm-To-C
> **Asm-To-C** technology for translating assembly code (x86/x64) into readable C code. It is based on line-by-line conversion of instructions: each assembler instruction is translated into an equivalent C macro that emulates the operation of registers, stack, flags (ZF, CF, OF, SF, PF, AF) and memory.
>
>Function calls are emulated via goto tags, push/pop via stack macros. The technology is inspired by the [cisol](https://github.com/rdbv/cisol) and adapted for integration into DeNuitkanizator.
>**Output format:** readable C code with comments that preserve the original assembly instructions. It is intended for analyzing and understanding the logic of binary code, not for compilation.

### ⚠️ Suspicious element detection
* **Anti‑debug API**: `IsDebuggerPresent`, `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent`, etc.
* **Anti‑debug code patterns**: `rdtsc`, `int 3`, `mov eax, fs:[30h]`.
* **Packed sections**: abnormal raw/virtual size ratio.
* **High entropy**: sections with high entropy (possible encryption).

### 🔄 Auto‑update
* Checks for new versions via GitHub API on launch.
* Status indicator: Latest / Update Available / Offline.

>[!WARNING]
> ### ⚠️ Limitations
> * **Does not restore original Python code.**
> * **Does not decompile machine code back to Python.**
> * **Does not guarantee 100% extraction of all data.**
> * May miss some info with aggressive **LTO optimization**.

## 📥 Installation

### Method 1: Pre‑built .exe
Download `DeNuitkanizator.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/2M12/DeNuitkanizator/releases) and run it.

### Method 2: From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/2M12/DeNuitkanizator.git
cd DeNuitkanizator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python DeNuitkanizator.py
```                                                       
---

## 🛠 Usage instructions
1. Launch `DeNuitkanizator.exe`, or if you downloaded the Python file, `DeNuitkanizator.py`.
2. Enter the path to the .exe file, or run: `python DeNuitkanizator.py "path"`.
3. The file analysis will start, and results will appear in the `DeNuitkanizator_Output` folder.
4. You can then review the files. `summary.txt` contains a summary only.
